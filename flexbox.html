            <p>CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a CSS web layout model.It is in the W3C's candidate recommendation (CR) stage. The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending on viewport size.Most web pages are written in a combination of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), JavaScript and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). In short, I did not write this filler text obviously why would I do that however HTML specifies the content and logical structure of the page, while the CSS specifies how it looks: its colors, fonts, formatting, layout, and styling. CSS flex-box layout is a particular way to specify the layout of HTML pages.</p>
            <p>One of the most defining features of the flex layout is its ability to form-fit, based on its viewing environment. Flex boxes can adjust in sizeâ€”either decreasing, to avoid unnecessarily monopolizing space, or increasing to make room for contents to fit within its boundaries. Moreover, the flex layout is less restrictive in terms of content flow than that of other CSS layout models, which are generally uni-directional. The flex directional flow can be specified rightwards, leftwards, upwards, or downwards. Individual items within a flex container may also be automatically rearranged to suit the available layout space.</p>
